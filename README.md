# Welcome to my Github Profile

I am a cybersecurity student with a wide interest from threat intelligence analysis to container security and related security engineering topics. As of now (Spring 2023) I am mostly working on my own personal website using github pages - my cybersecurity labs have all been housed and completed locally so far, aside from forking some source repositories to start. My hope is to refine my skill and begin using Github more effectively with security related projects. My MS in cybersecurity will be completed in May. My next journey should *finally* be transitioning into FTE that aligns with my security engineering, or related, career interests.

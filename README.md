# Welcome to my Github Profile

I am a cybersecurity student with a wide interest from threat intelligence analysis to container security and related security engineering topics. As of now (Spring 2023) I am mostly working on my own personal website using github pages - my cybersecurity labs have all been housed and completed locally so far, aside from forking some source repositories to start. My hope is to refine my skill and begin using Github more effectively with security related projects. My MS in cybersecurity will be completed in May. My next journey should *finally* be transitioning into FTE that aligns with my cloud security engineering, or related, career interests. 

<i>"In the Big Rock Candy Mountains<br>
There's a land that's fair and bright<br>
Where the handouts grow on bushes<br>
And you sleep out every night<br>
Where the boxcars all are empty<br>
And the sun shines everyday<br>
All the birds and the bees<br>
And the cigarette trees<br>
The lemonade springs<br>
Where the bluebird sings<br>
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains<br>
<br>
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains<br>
All the cops have wooden legs<br>
And the bulldogs all have rubber teeth<br>
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs<br>
The farmers' trees are full of fruit<br>
And the barns are full of hay<br>
Oh, I'm bound to go<br>
Where there ain't no snow<br>
Where the rain don't fall<br>
The wind don't blow<br>
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains"</i><br>
